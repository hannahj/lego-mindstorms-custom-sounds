# lego-mindstorms-custom-sounds

Automates the addition of new .wav files into LEGO MINDSTORMS Robot Inventor and SPIKE projects (only tested with Inventor).

Build's on Daniele Benedettelli's (Danny's Lab) tutorial for
"Adding custom sounds to LEGO MINDSTORMS Robot Inventor / SPIKE projects": https://robotics.benedettelli.com/adding-sounds-mindstorms-spike-projects/

Patches welcome.
